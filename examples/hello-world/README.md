# Print Hello World in Clarity

The primary intent of this example is to demonstrate printing "Hello World" within a Clarity function. The example also demonstrates both read-only and public functions, simple handling of function parameters, and throwing an error within a function.

## Know your Contract

Review the [hello-world.clar](/examples/hello-world/contracts/hello-world.clar) contract.

You can interact with this sample by commenting/uncommenting respective functions, altering the behavior, and running them through Clarinet or unit tests.

To add new contracts, follow detailed instructions at [Add new Contract](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-add-contract).

> **NOTE**: To use this example with Clarinet inside [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so), you can open the terminal session inside VS code by navigating to File -> View -> Terminal.

## Test your Contract

- You can manually test your your contracts in the [Clarinet console](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-test-contract#load-contracts-in-a-console).
- You can programmatically test your contracts with [unit tests](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-test-contract).
