# Print Hello World in Clarity

The primary intent of this example is to demonstrate printing "Hello World" in Clarity. Additionally, there are Clarity samples for arithmetic operations, defining and applying constants, and using "maps" and "fold" as utilities, among others.

## Know your Contract

Review the [hello-world.clar](/examples/hello-world/contracts/hello-world.clar) contract.

We want developers to familiarize themselves with these basic concepts. You can interact with this sample by commenting/uncommenting respective functions, altering the behavior, and running them through Clarinet or unit tests.

To add new contracts, follow detailed instructions at [Add new Contract](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-add-contract).

> **NOTE**: To use this example with Clarinet inside [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so), you can open the terminal session inside VS code by navigating to File -> View -> Terminal.

## Test your Contract

+ You can manually test your your contracts in the [Clarinet console](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-test-contract#load-contracts-in-a-console).
+ You can programmatically test your contracts with [unit tests](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-test-contract).
