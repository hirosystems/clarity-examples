# Welcome to Clarity Examples

The Clarity Examples repository includes a collection of reusable [Clarity](https://clarity-lang.org/) smart contracts. These examples can help developers rapidly kickstart their journey onto the Stacks blockchain.

Furthermore, [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so/) allows developers to discover these smart contracts, clone, extend, and deploy the customized contracts—in a few clicks—all from the browser.

> **NOTE**: The examples provided in this repository are for educational purposes and have not been security audited.

## Logistics

All examples include a README and some have pointers to real-world projects in the Stacks blockchain.

Each example also includes unit tests under the `/tests` directory to help guide developers to familiarize themselves with testing concepts.

Additionally, each example can run in Clarinet as-is. In a terminal of choice and with [Clarinet](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/getting-started) installed, developers can go to the respective example folder, run `clarinet check`, `clarinet integrate`, and explore other [Clarinet features](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/introduction).

Alternatively, you can skip setting up your development environment on your laptop and instead go to https://platform.hiro.so to let Hiro Platform do all the heavy lifting of setting it up on your behalf. You can select the example of choice, explore the code, customize it, or deploy it to Stacks blockchain in a few clicks.

With Hiro Platform, we want to encourage developers to focus on shipping their business models to Stacks blockchain, ship often and happily, and not get caught up with unboxing and infrastructure overhead.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

To prepare the project for development, run `npm i` from the root of your local clone/fork.

This project contains a pre-commit script that will generate a new `metadata.json` file and new contents of the `zips` folder based on your changes. This script will run automatically pre-commit, or you can run it manually using the command `npm run build`.
